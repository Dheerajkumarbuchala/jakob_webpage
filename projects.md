# Some Current Research Projects

Currently I am working on Multi-Agent Systems.<br>
I have worked on Coalition Structure Generation. I have submitted a thesis on "Algorithms for Coaliton Structure Generation". The main concentration in the 
dissertation is on the “Heuristic Methods for Optimal Coalition Structure 
Generation developed by Amir & Shaheen”.
We have developed a parallel heuristic method using multi-threading and the results were quite promising.

Our research paper “P-TACOS: A Parallel Tabu Search Algorithm for Coalition Structure Generation”, developed based on my thesis has been accepted in short format for publication in the WI-IAT 2023 proceedings and for oral presentation at the conference.
